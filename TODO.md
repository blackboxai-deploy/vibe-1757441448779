# Calculator Implementation TODO

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Create root layout (src/app/layout.tsx)
- [ ] Create main calculator page (src/app/page.tsx)
- [ ] Create Calculator component with logic (src/components/Calculator.tsx)
- [ ] Install dependencies (pnpm install)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Build application (pnpm run build --no-lint)
- [ ] Start server (pnpm start)
- [ ] Test calculator functionality
- [ ] Verify responsive design
- [ ] Test error handling (division by zero)
- [ ] Final preview and demonstration
